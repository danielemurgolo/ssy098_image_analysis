# SSY098 Image Analysis[^1]

This repository contains the labs and project for the Image Analysis course.

## Labs

The course has four labs:

### [Lab 1: SIFT Descriptor](./lab1)
This lab covers the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor, which is a widely-used method for feature detection and description in computer vision.
### [Lab 2: Learning and Convolutional Networks](./lab2)
In this lab, you'll learn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks commonly used in image analysis and computer vision tasks.
### [Lab 3: Image Registration with RANSAC](./lab3)  
Image registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same scene taken from different viewpoints or at different times. This lab covers the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for image registration.
### [Lab 4: Triangulation](./labs/lab4) 
Triangulation is the process of estimating the position of a point in 3D space based on its projection onto two or more 2D images. This lab covers the triangulation algorithm used in computer vision.

Each lab includes a MATLAB Live Script and a PDF export of the Live Script.

## Project

The project is on Image Classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). You can find the project in the [project](./project) directory.
