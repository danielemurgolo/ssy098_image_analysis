# SSY098 Image Analysis

This repository contains the labs and project for the Image Analysis course.

## Labs

The course has four labs:

### [Lab 1: SIFT Descriptor](./lab1)
This lab covers the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor, which is a widely-used method for feature detection and description in computer vision.
### [Lab 2: Learning and Convolutional Networks](./lab2)
In this lab, you'll learn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks commonly used in image analysis and computer vision tasks.
### [Lab 3: Image Registration with RANSAC](./lab3)  
Image registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same scene taken from different viewpoints or at different times. This lab covers the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for image registration.
### [Lab 4: Triangulation](./labs/lab4) 
Triangulation is the process of estimating the position of a point in 3D space based on its projection onto two or more 2D images. This lab covers the triangulation algorithm used in computer vision.

## [Project: CIFAR-10 Image Classification](./project)

The project is on Image Classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, you will need to install MATLAB on your machine. You will also need to download and install the following MATLAB toolboxes:

- Image Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox

You can download these toolboxes from the MathWorks website.

## Usage

Each lab is accompanied by a MATLAB script that contains the code and instructions for that lab. To start a lab, simply open the corresponding script and follow the instructions.

The final project is also accompanied by a MATLAB script that contains the code and instructions for building a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or bugs in the code, please feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue. Contributions are always welcome!
